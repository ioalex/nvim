## Introduction

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://nvim.com)

This repository contains my personal configuration files for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), a Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability.

Like many, I have scoured the Internet in search of the best Vim configurations and plugins. I have stalked down quite a few Gists and dotfile / vimrc repositories of some [smart smart people](#acknowledgements) and have tried out their settings for myself. McVim is a collection of their hard work with my own finishing touches - spice. ðŸŒ¶

Whether or not the McVimâ„¢ is the 'best' configuration for Neovim is up to personal opinion, but noone can deny that it is indeed the spiciest!!!

If you dislike spicy goodness, have an allergy or just don't have the appetite, feel free to pick apart the McVimâ„¢ and take / use the bits you like - or don't use it at all, I won't hurt you!

If you're not a picky eater, then definitely give the McVimâ„¢ a try! It's a quick way to dive into a cozy development environment in the terminal without doing the tedious configuring yourself.

## Quick Notes

Note:
The many comments throughout the Vim files serve as reminders for myself and as guides for Vim-beginners who somehow find their way here!

I like to keep my configuration updated regularly and will try to keep a record of what I need to do. If you're curious about what I'm working on, feel free to have a look at the [TODO](https://github.com/ioalex/nvim/blob/master/nvim.todo) file.

I am always open to suggestions as to what I should add or remove from my configuration. Please feel free to fork the project to do so. There are more detailed steps [below](#contributing). Thanks in advance!

Another Note: The Spicy McVimâ„¢ has no relations to the fast food conglomerate that is McDonalds and is not actually trademarked - I just thought the â„¢ symbol looked neat. ðŸ˜…
